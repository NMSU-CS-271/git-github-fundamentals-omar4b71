## Who am I?
I am Omar Bashammakh. I am an EE major with a minor in Computer Engineering.
I would like to see me doing something amazing by the end of this class, but I am also
afraid that I may face huge difficulties. However, with an amazing professor like you, I
am sure that I will get all the help I need.
